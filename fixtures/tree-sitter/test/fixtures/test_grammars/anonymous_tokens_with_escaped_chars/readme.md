Every token in a grammar is given a name in the generated parser. Anonymous tokens (tokens specified directly in the body of some larger rule) are named according their content. So when tokens contains characters that aren't valid in a C string literal, we need to escape those characters. This grammar tests that this escaping works. The test is basically that the generated parser compiles succesfully.
